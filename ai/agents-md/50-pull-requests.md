A PR body has four parts:
1. Summary.
2. A Mermaid diagram of the change.
3. "One-way or two-way door?" with a reason.
4. Blast radius: what else can break.
The author-sessions block goes at the end (next section). The pr-rules gate blocks a PR without a mermaid block or without that block.

PR author-sessions note
When you create a PR, or push changes to an open PR, keep this hidden block at the end of the PR body, before the generated-with footer:

<!-- author-sessions
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
main:   <session-id>  dir: <cwd, with ~ for $HOME>  # <what this session did>
herdr:  <session-id>  dir: <cwd, with ~ for $HOME>  # <what this agent did>
-->
main is your own session. Get the ID with herdr agent get "$HERDR_PANE_ID" | jq -r '.result.agent.agent_session.value'.
Add one herdr line for each Herdr agent that you started or prompted for this PR. Get its ID the same way with its agent name or pane ID, and its dir from .result.agent.cwd.
Do not add subagents. They resume with the main session.
On an update, keep the existing lines, add the new ones, and change updated.
When you edit the PR body for other reasons (for example a recap skill), keep this block.
If an ID is empty, write main: unknown (or herdr: unknown) and tell me. Do not guess an ID.
pr-resume parses this block. Keep the line format exact: one ID, dir:, one path without spaces.
